- Spring REST project structure
- Entities and ORM
- Database seeding
- Layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository
- DTO pattern for data transfer
- N-N relationships with association class and embedded ID
- SQL queries with Spring Data JPA and Projections

### Project Profiles

The project has different profiles to adapt to different environments:

- Development and testing profile:
  - `test`
  - H2 database

- Staging profile:
  - `dev`
  - Homologation PostgreSQL database

- Production profile:
  - `prod`
  - Production PostgreSQL database
  - The project is deployed in the cloud at the following address: [https://gamelists.up.railway.app](https://gamelists.up.railway.app)
  - You can retrieve the API data by making a GET request to the following endpoint: `/games`
  - You can retrieve the game lists by making a GET request to the following endpoint: `/lists`

### Environment Configuration

- You can use Docker Compose to easily configure the local environment.
- Local homologation process is supported to test the application before deployment.
- It is recommended to set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process to automate the application deployment.

### CORS Configuration

The application has CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configurations to allow access from different origins, ensuring proper security and interoperability.

### How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Configure the environment as needed (Docker, project profiles, database).
3. Run the project using your preferred IDE or through the command line with the `mvn spring-boot:run` command.
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080` or the address provided by your configuration.
